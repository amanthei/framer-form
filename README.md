![alt text](https://github.com/emilwidlund/framer-form/blob/master/marketing/banner.png?raw=true)

Framer Form is a <a href="https://framer.com" target="_blank">Framer</a>-module built with the purpose of exposing an extremely easy-to-use API for rendering 3D-graphics. Its purpose is not to reinvent and improve existing WebGL-rendering techniques, its purpose is rather to take existing techniques & libraries and expose them in the Framer Environment. It is built to support common Framer-concepts like Animations, States & Events in mind.

### What can you expect from this module?

As most people probably want to import their own models & 3D-meshes to their Framer Prototype, Framer Form will have solid support for a wide array of different file formats. Import anything from FBX, DAE & OBJ to JSON files, and have their respective materials applied with one simple line of code.

#### Currently Supported File Formats
- OBJ / MTL
- FBX
- GLTF / GLB
- DAE
- JSON

### What does the syntax look like?

Framer Form aims to deliver an easy and familiar syntax for all its components. Framer Form has 2 fundamental components that you will interact with.
